## Briefly About me:

I am a candidate PhD student in computer science and a research assistant at [Information Sciences Institute (ISI)](https://www.isi.edu/) in [University of Southern California (USC)](https://www.usc.edu/), Los Angeles. I work in Natural Language Processing Group under the supervision of Prof. Jonathan May. My research purpose is to adapt a cross-domain and multilingual approach to different semantic tasks mainly related to dialogue systems and information extraction in low resource setting. Prior to joining ISI, I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from [Al Akhawayn University (AUI)](http://www.aui.ma/en/) in Morocco and a Master in Computer Science from [Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/) in Swizerland. My research aspirations come from her passion for learning new languages and discovering new cultures through traveling.
